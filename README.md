# LeetCode_September_Challenge
This is my code submissions for September Leetcoding Challenge 2021. ( Java )

1. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game

Given: 
Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:
Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.
The first player A always places 'X' characters, while the second player B always places 'O' characters.
'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
No more moves can be played if the game is over.
Given a 2D integer array moves where moves[i] = [rowi, coli] indicates that the ith move will be played on grid[rowi][coli]. 
return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B). In case the game ends in a draw return "Draw". If there are still movements to play return "Pending".
You can assume that moves is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty, and A will play first.

2. Max Consecutive Ones

Given:
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

3. N-th Tribonacci Number

Given:
The Tribonacci sequence T(n) is defined as follows: 
T(0) = 0, T(1) = 1, T(2) = 1, and T(n+3) = T(n) + T(n+1) + T(n+2) for n >= 0.

Given n, return the value of T(n).
